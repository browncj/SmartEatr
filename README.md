#SmartEatr

A tool to track food consumption. Calculates food energy based off of macronutrient spread. Supports setting custom goals for daily energy intake as well as logging multiple days.

Primarily developed using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to render the page and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to maintain state. For easier styling [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is also employed. ES6 is transpiled using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and the entire app is wrapped up using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). Data is automatically written to local storage and is persistent, but can be cleared. Testing implemented using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

This is a work in progress. Feel free to contact me with any suggested features. Planned updates include mobile support, an independent cloud backend (such as Firebase) as well as possible integration with React Native.
